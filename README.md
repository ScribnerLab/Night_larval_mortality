# Night_larval_mortality


# This file includes all data used for "Experimental evidence for the effects of nocturnal light conditions on predation levels by riverine predators on larval prey," paper submitted to Journal of Freshwater Ecology.  The data includes results and co-variates of raceway trials in which larval lake sturgeon, suckers, and Heptageniid mayflies were released in a stream-like mesocosm and passed by two individuals of a predatory fish species.  
# Here is an explanation of each column:
# Trial: An arbitrary number given to each trial used for organization.  This number is not reflective of order or trial date.  
# Lux: Measure of lux during the trial.
# Initial: The initial number of each prey taxa released in the mesocosm.
# Sturgeon: Number of lake sturgeon consumed by predators
# Sucker: Number of suckers consumed by predators
# Hept: Number of Heptageniid mayflies consumed by predators
# Pred_cm: The average predator length minus the average predator length for that species
# Prop_sturgeon: The proportion of the predators' diet made up by lake sturgeon
# Prop_sucker: The proportion of the predators' diet made up by suckers
# Prop_hept: The proportion of the predators' diet made up by mayflies
# Temp: The temperature during the trial minus the average temperature over all trials
# sum: The total number of prey consumed during the trial
# Predator: Species of predator, either rock bass or hornyhead chub
# Light: Whether the lux was reflective of full moon or new moon light
# Sturg_select: Same as Prop_sturgeon
# Suck_select: Same as Prop_sucker
# Hept_select: Same as Prop_hept
# Pred_cm_raw: average length of two predators
# Temp_raw: Temperature during trial
